# **A Comparison of NoSQL Database Management Systems and Models**

### *Intro*
NoSQL refers to database management systems that does not use the relational model. Here, in this paper, four mainly NoSQL database models and its example are discussed. 

### *Four mainly NoSQL models*
First model is key-value databases, which define a single collection without any structure, for example, Redis database. Second model is columnar database, which stores data into separate column file, for example Apache HBase. Third model is document-oriented database, in which each document has a unique key, the document is treated as the value. They also contain metadata in document which tells them apart from key-value databases, for example, MongoDB. The fourth one is graph databases. This model adds an extra layer to document model to highlight the relationships between individual documents, for example, Neo4j. 





# **Introduction to data lakes**

### *Pros*
A data lakes storage large scaler data in raw format, using a flat architecture and object storage. Data lakes can transform raw data with low latency. Also, the centralized feature avoids the problem of data silos. Any data types can be storage. It is also more user friendly than other models. 

### *Cons*
The shortage of data lakes are reliability issues, slow performance, and lack of security features. 

### *Better solution*
Lakehouse can solve those shortages by adding a transactional storage layer on top of the data lake. For example, the Delta Lake is successfully lakehouse strategy, which combine the advantages of both data lakes and data warehouse, such as all types of data, open format, high performance et al.
