## Title: A potential key to open the chamber of secrets of neurocognitive functions by applying Thunder---a big data tools in neuroscience field

No doubt, neuroactivity is one of the fundamental pieces of the cognitive function. With the development of neuroscience research technical, researchers are getting better at recording high-resolution and real-time imaging of neural firing or cognitive behavior data. In this case, massive data sets are generated, which is flooding the researchers. Because of that, neuroscience research field have been recognized as an important field which could benefit from the big data method. However, there are still some general challenges to apply big data systems into neuroscience field. Similar to other fields, these challenges include data collection and sharing, data infrastructure construction, and data analysis methods [[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6943787/)]. 
       
Thunder, is a big data tools devolved by Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). This group published their first paper about Thunder tools at high impact journal, Nature Method at 2014 [[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25068736/)]. After further checking on this tool, I found Databricks also put this tool in their library [[3](https://databricks.com/session/a-platform-for-large-scale-neuroscience)]. Here, in the research paper, the method of applying Thunder in neuroscience imaging analysis will be discussed detailly. More importantly, the challenge of using this tool in neuroscience will be also touched. The last content will be about the current usage of Thunder tools in neuroscience field and possible optimization of this tools.
